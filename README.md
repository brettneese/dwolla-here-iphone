==================

Fork of Dwolla's open-source iOS app. Originally built by <a href= "https://github.com/nschulze"> Nick Schulze </a> 
and the Dwolla team. While originally built by Dwolla and utilzing Dwolla's API, this app is an unofficial alternative
to Dwolla's iPhone app. 

#FAQ

##You're charging for this app on the app store! Can't I just donwload this for free and laod it on my phone?

Sure, go right ahead. You'll have to modify the API keys and such, and you'll need to be a registered iOS developer
and pay a program fee of $99/year. I'm selling this for a modest fee because I know some people won't want to do that
-- normally, I'd be one of them. :) 

So I invested my own $99 and am simply trying to recover that and maybe be compensated for my time a little bit. 

Given the time, effort, and personal investment I've spent fixing some lingering bugs readying the open source app for
app store disturbution, I feel like charging a modest fee seems appopriate and fair.

That being said, I'm reciperocrating all of my changes as open source, so feel free to fork 
my fork, and do with it what you will.

## Who are you?

I'm a college student, and this is entirely voluntarily. I've never been a fan of Dwolla's iPhone app, 
so when they posted an open-source app that I feel is much superior to the existed app, I felt compelled to make it
available to all.  That being said, this effort is largely volutnarily. I have no formal affilation with the Dwolla Corporation, though 
I'm a huge supporter and know a lot about their API.
