dwolla-here-iphone
==================

Fork of Dwolla's open-source iOS app. Originally built by <a href= "https://github.com/nschulze"> Nick Schulze </a> 
and the Dwolla team. 

While originally built by Dwolla and utilzing Dwolla's API, this app is an unofficial alternative
to Dwolla's iPhone app. 

#FAQ

##You're charging for this app on the app store! Can't I just donwload this for free and load it on my phone?

Sure, go right ahead. You'll have to modify the API keys and such, and you'll need to be a registered iOS developer
and pay a program fee of $99/year. I'm selling this for a modest fee because I know some people won't want to do that
-- normally, I'd be one of them. :) 

So I invested my own $99 and am simply trying to recover that and maybe be compensated for my time a little bit. 

Given the time, effort, and personal investment I've spent fixing some lingering bugs readying the open source app for
app store disturbution, I feel like charging a modest fee seems appopriate and fair.

That being said, I'm reciperocrating all of my changes as open source, so feel free to fork 
my fork, and do with it what you will.

## What's different than the official iOS app?

This app is much faster and much easier to use. You can withdraw and deposit directly within the app -- no messing
around with Instant nor going to the website. Given the primary reason one uses the Dwolla iPhone app is to pay 
venues around them, this app immediately opens to a list of venues and people around you the moment you open in it --
no waiting for your balance to update, nor hitting any extra buttons.

## What's different from the open source "mobile wallet"?

Not much. I removed the fugly "requests" banner because it was fugly and gimmicky and I didn't like it. I fixed an iOS 
7 bug related to the status bar. That's about it.

I'm working on putting a much cleaner Requests flow in, as well as updating the look and feel to match my
own personal style -- hell, I may even give it a complete iOS 7 facelift. I also have a couple things
I desperately want to add but this is my first iOS experience so I'm learning as I go and progress is slow.


## Who are you?

My name is Brett Neese. I'm a college student from Des Moines, Iowa, and this is entirely voluntary. I've never been a fan of Dwolla's official iPhone app, 
so when they posted an open-source app that I feel is much superior to the existing app, I felt compelled to make it
available to all. That being said, I have no formal affilation with the Dwolla Corporation, though 
I'm a huge supporter and know a lot about their API.

If you'd like to support this project more than buying the app and telling your friends about the app, you could
always buy me some pizza. :)
